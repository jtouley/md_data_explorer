# 230 C.O.R.E. Output Format (MVP)

Role
Ensure human-facing outputs are fast to scan and decision-first.

Applies To
- /plan-review
- /spec-audit (if used)
- /spec-driven (human checkpoints)
- /postmortem (summary section only, if used)

Mandatory Format
All human-facing output MUST be structured as:

## SUMMARY

**Status: ✅ [READY FOR USE | IN PROGRESS | BLOCKED]**

(1–2 lines, outcome only)

## DECISIONS NEEDED

(Max 3 items)
Each item MUST state:
- the decision
- why it matters
- what happens if delayed

## ACTIONS REQUIRED 🚨

Checklist format only.
Each action must be explicit and bounded.
Bold action text with context/deadline/impact.

## EVIDENCE

- file paths + section anchors (use backticks)
- test names
- diff references
- Group by: Created / Updated / Quality Gates
(NO large text blocks)

## OPTIONAL CONTEXT

Only include if explicitly requested.
Compress deferred items into bullets.
Keep prose minimal.

Prohibited
- Long prose
- Full file dumps
- Narrative explanations
- Unbounded output (>80 lines without override)

Enforcement
If format is violated:
- Rewrite output to comply
- Do not proceed with execution

Example Good Output:
```markdown
## SUMMARY

**Status: ✅ READY FOR USE**

Plan is viable but blocked on 2 decisions.

## DECISIONS NEEDED

1) Choose aggregation strategy for edge case X — impacts correctness.
2) Confirm performance constraint (batch vs streaming) — impacts architecture.

## ACTIONS REQUIRED 🚨

- [ ] **Decide strategy for X** — blocks test implementation
- [ ] **Confirm performance constraint** — affects architecture choice

## EVIDENCE

**Updated:**
- `.cursor/plans/feature_plan.md#Section-3`

**Tests:**
- Failing: `test_aggregation.py::test_edge_case_x`

## OPTIONAL CONTEXT

**What's Deferred (intentionally):**
- Token telemetry
- Spec deltas
- Subagent orchestration
```

Example Bad Output:
```
I've been looking at this plan and there are several interesting things to consider.
First, let's talk about the overall architecture...
[3 pages of narrative]
```

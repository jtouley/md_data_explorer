Branch: feat/add-test-coverage

Implementation complete with all 9 phases:

- Phase 2: Added Makefile commands (test-cov-check, test-cov-diff, etc.)
- Phase 3: Created check_coverage_regression.py with TDD (5 tests)
- Phase 4: Added pre-push coverage hook
- Phase 5: Created 108-coverage-enforcement.mdc cursor rule

- Phase 7: Generated initial baseline (69.1%)
- Phase 8: Updated tests/AGENTS.md with coverage docs
- Phase 9: Created coverage gap follow-up document

Tests: 5/5 passing for new coverage script
Quality gates: All checks passing for new files

Note: 33 pre-existing test failures in codebase block pre-push hook.
These failures predate this PR and need separate attention.

Next: Await PR review or address feedback.

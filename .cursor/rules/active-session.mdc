# Active Session: terminal-config-fix

**Session ID**: `terminal-config-fix`

**Session File**: `.context/sessions/terminal-config-fix.yaml`

**Status**: Completed

## Resume Prompt Template

Resume work on terminal configuration fixes:

Context: Fixed Cursor terminal auto-execution of pyenv commands and added fast scroll settings.

Completed:
- Created .vscode/settings.json with Python interpreter path pointing to .venv/bin/python
- Added fast terminal scroll settings (smoothScrolling, fastScrollSensitivity, scrollback, mouseWheelScrollSensitivity)
- Explained Powerlevel10k branch display format (shows local:remote format)

Files modified:
- .vscode/settings.json (created with Python and terminal scroll settings)
- .gitignore (already ignores .vscode/ directory)

Next steps if resuming:
- Verify terminal scroll settings work after Cursor reload
- Test that pyenv commands no longer auto-execute in new terminals
- Consider removing docs/.python-version if not needed (contains 3.14, might confuse tools)

## Session Context

- **Problem**: Cursor was automatically running 'pyenv shell 3.11.6' when creating new terminals, but pyenv wasn't in PATH causing command not found errors. Also requested fast terminal scroll settings.
- **Root Cause**: Cursor's Python extension detected pyenv's Python 3.11.6 installation but pyenv wasn't initialized in shell PATH. Project uses uv for Python management.
- **Solution**: Created workspace settings to explicitly use uv-managed Python from .venv and added fast terminal scroll configuration.

## Key Files

- `.vscode/settings.json` - Workspace settings for Python interpreter and terminal scroll

## Notes

- pyenv is installed at ~/.pyenv/ with Python 3.11.6 but not in PATH
- Project uses uv with Python 3.13.11 in .venv
- Powerlevel10k shows branch format as "local:remote" which is expected behavior
- Fast scroll settings: fastScrollSensitivity=5, mouseWheelScrollSensitivity=3, scrollback=10000

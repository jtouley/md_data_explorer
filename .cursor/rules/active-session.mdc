# Active Session: pr21-feedback-merge-ready

## Session File
`.context/sessions/pr21-feedback-merge-ready.yaml`

## Resume Prompt
Resume PR21 feedback implementation session.
Branch: feat/queryplan-as-product-critical-fixes
Commit: 535a86a
Status: All PR21 fixes implemented and verified. Ready for merge.

Blockers addressed:
1. hash(query_text) replaced with sha256 - verified no remaining hash() calls
2. Mapper NULL handling - verified downstream consumers use drop_nulls()

Next action: Merge PR or address any additional reviewer feedback.

## Key Context
- Semantic layer owns run_key generation (PR21 architecture)
- 786 tests passing, 17 failing (dataset availability, not PR21-related)
- All quality gates green (lint, format)

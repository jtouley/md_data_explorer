# Active Session: test-consolidation-patient-id

## Session File
.context/sessions/test-consolidation-patient-id.yaml

## Resume Prompt
Resume session: test-consolidation-patient-id

Context: Consolidated duplicate patient_id tests and fixed test failures. Tests are now properly
separated into unit tests (test_composite_identifier.py) and integration tests 
(test_uploaded_dataset_patient_id.py). All 5 tests passing.

Current status:
- Test files committed (ab3d917)
- Source code changes in src/ are uncommitted and should be included in the same commit

Next steps:
1. Review uncommitted source changes in src/
2. Amend commit to include source changes: `git add src/ && git commit --amend --no-edit`
3. Verify all tests still pass after including source changes

  Resume work on multi-table progress visibility and verbose logging implementation.
  
  Current state:
  - Progress callback system added to save_zip_upload() in user_datasets.py
  - UI progress bars and detailed logging added to Upload_Data.py page
  - Streamlit launch script updated for verbose mode (--logger.level=info)
  - Comprehensive test suite created (test_zip_upload_progress.py) - all 6 tests passing
  - Verbose logging working: shows individual table loading with row/column counts
  - Relationship detection logging: shows 94 relationships detected for MIMIC-IV demo
  - Progress tracking: real-time updates for each table (1/32, 2/32, etc.)
  
  Completed:
  - ✅ Progress callback parameter added to save_zip_upload()
  - ✅ Progress updates at each step: initialization, table discovery, loading, relationship detection, cohort building, saving, schema inference
  - ✅ UI progress bar and status text in Streamlit
  - ✅ Expandable processing log showing each table as it loads
  - ✅ Detailed table information (rows, cols) in progress callbacks
  - ✅ Logging configuration with INFO level for multi_table_handler and user_datasets
  - ✅ All tests passing (6/6) verifying progress callback functionality
  - ✅ Fixed indentation errors
  - ✅ Fixed ruff linting issues (whitespace, imports, type hints)
  - ✅ Fixed step calculation bug (total_steps consistency)
  
  Current issue:
  - ❌ DuckDB OutOfMemoryException when joining all 32 tables in single query
  - Error: "failed to offload data block of size 32.0 KiB (90.8 GiB/90.8 GiB used)"
  - Large tables like chartevents (668,862 rows) causing memory explosion
  - Single massive LEFT JOIN of all tables exhausts temp directory space
  
  Proposed solutions (not yet implemented):
  1. Configure DuckDB with better memory settings (memory_limit, threads, temp_directory)
  2. Use incremental joins instead of single massive join
  3. Selective joins - exclude very large tables by default (e.g., chartevents > 100k rows)
  
  Key decisions:
  - Progress callback signature: (step: int, total_steps: int, message: str, details: dict) -> None
  - Total steps calculation: 1 (init) + len(csv_files) (loading) + 4 (detect, build, save, infer)
  - UI shows progress bar, status text, and expandable log container
  - Logging at INFO level for visibility without overwhelming output
  - Tests verify callback is called, receives correct data, and handles edge cases
  
  Next steps:
  1. Fix DuckDB memory issue - configure connection with appropriate limits
  2. Consider incremental join strategy for very large datasets
  3. Add option to exclude large tables from unified cohort
  4. Test with full MIMIC-IV demo dataset (32 tables, some with 600k+ rows)

notes: |
  - Verbose logging successfully implemented and working
  - Progress visibility excellent: users can see each table loading individually
  - Relationship detection working well: 94 relationships detected with high confidence
  - Memory issue discovered when processing full MIMIC-IV demo with 32 tables
  - Need to optimize join strategy for large multi-table datasets

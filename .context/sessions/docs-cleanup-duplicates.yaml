  notes: |
    Identified duplicate files in docs/architecture/:
    - ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md (duplicate of overview.md)
    - IBIS_SEMANTIC_LAYER.md (duplicate of semantic-layer.md)
    
    MkDocs uses lowercase versions (overview.md, semantic-layer.md) per mkdocs.yml lines 73-74.
    README.md still references uppercase versions in 11 locations.
    
    Action required:
    1. Delete docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md
    2. Delete docs/architecture/IBIS_SEMANTIC_LAYER.md
    3. Update docs/README.md to reference lowercase versions:
       - architecture/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md → architecture/overview.md
       - architecture/IBIS_SEMANTIC_LAYER.md → architecture/semantic-layer.md

prompt_template: |
  Resume documentation cleanup work: remove duplicate architecture files and update references.
  
  Status: Identified duplicates, ready to delete and update references.
  
  Duplicate files identified:
  - docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md (duplicate of overview.md)
  - docs/architecture/IBIS_SEMANTIC_LAYER.md (duplicate of semantic-layer.md)
  
  MkDocs configuration uses lowercase versions:
  - architecture/overview.md (line 73 in mkdocs.yml)
  - architecture/semantic-layer.md (line 74 in mkdocs.yml)
  
  README.md needs updates in 11 locations:
  - Line 39: architecture/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md → architecture/overview.md
  - Line 51: architecture/IBIS_SEMANTIC_LAYER.md → architecture/semantic-layer.md
  - Line 147: architecture/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md → architecture/overview.md
  - Line 154: architecture/IBIS_SEMANTIC_LAYER.md → architecture/semantic-layer.md
  - Line 160: architecture/IBIS_SEMANTIC_LAYER.md → architecture/semantic-layer.md
  - Line 185: architecture/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md → architecture/overview.md
  - Line 187: architecture/IBIS_SEMANTIC_LAYER.md → architecture/semantic-layer.md
  - Line 225: architecture/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md → architecture/overview.md
  - Line 226: architecture/IBIS_SEMANTIC_LAYER.md → architecture/semantic-layer.md
  - Line 265: architecture/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md → architecture/overview.md
  - Line 292: architecture/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md → architecture/overview.md
  
  Tasks:
  1. Delete duplicate files
  2. Update all README.md references to lowercase versions
  3. Verify no broken links remain
